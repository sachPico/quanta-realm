# Gameplay
Player will control a space assault soldier equipped with a long-range weapon dubbed "The Jaw". The Jaw utilizes fragment of the unknown energy source to power it. The more fragment the user put, the more powerful The Jaw will be. The Jaw consists of three different weapon system; Major Long-Range Weapon, Minor Long-Range Weapon, and Instant AoE Weapon. Except for Instant AoE, the power of MaLRW and MiLRW weapon can be adjusted. MaLRW offers vast attack area, which will get larger as the user upgraded The Jaw, but the attack power will be slightly reduced. In contrast with MaLRW, MiLRW instead offers a stronger attack but at a slower fire rate than MaLRW. Instant AoE will create a dangerous zone to attack enemy units for some amount period of time.
